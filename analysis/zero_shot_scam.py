"""Zero-shot Scam Classification — mDeBERTa multilingual NLI.

Uses `MoritzLaurer/mDeBERTa-v3-base-xnli-multilingual-nli-2mil7` for
zero-shot scam/fraud classification across 100+ languages including Hindi
and Tamil. No training data needed — define labels and classify.

Custom labels for financial call context:
  - scam_call: caller is running a scam
  - social_engineering: caller is manipulating the victim
  - credential_phishing: caller is extracting passwords/OTPs/PINs
  - identity_theft: caller is collecting personal information for fraud
  - legitimate_banking: normal banking interaction

Runs on CPU (~560MB). ~50ms per sentence.
